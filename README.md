# Suplementario_School
Jorge Lizarazo

This project, part of Juan Perez's thesis supervised by PhD Maria Isabel Rivas, analyzes high school students' responses to questions before and after a special activity. Data from two schools show an increase in the average number of letters and words in the responses after the activity, with no significant impact from the question difficulty. Further analysis will explore differences between the schools and other potential factors influencing the responses.
